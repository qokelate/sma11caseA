<h3 class="section">3.8 Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</h3>

<p><a name="index-options-to-control-warnings-181"></a><a name="index-warning-messages-182"></a><a name="index-messages_002c-warning-183"></a><a name="index-suppressing-warnings-184"></a>
Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which
are not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.

 </p><p>You can request many specific warnings with options beginning `<samp><span class="samp">-W</span></samp>',
for example <samp><span class="option">-Wimplicit</span></samp> to request warnings on implicit
declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also has a
negative form beginning `<samp><span class="samp">-Wno-</span></samp>' to turn off warnings;
for example, <samp><span class="option">-Wno-implicit</span></samp>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.

 </p><p>The following options control the amount and kinds of warnings produced
by GCC; for further, language-specific options also refer to
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.4/gcc/C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">C++ Dialect Options</a> and <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.4/gcc/Objective_002dC-Dialect-Options.html#Objective_002dC-Dialect-Options">Objective-C Dialect Options</a>.

     
<a name="index-syntax-checking-185"></a>
</p><dl><dt><code>-fsyntax-only</code></dt><dd><a name="index-fsyntax_002donly-186"></a>Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-pedantic</code></dt><dd><a name="index-pedantic-187"></a>Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++.  For ISO C, follows the
version of the ISO C standard specified by any <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> option used.

     <p>Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few will require <samp><span class="option">-ansi</span></samp> or a
<samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> option specifying the required version of ISO C).  However,
without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C and C++
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.

     </p><p><samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp> does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with `<samp><span class="samp">__</span></samp>'.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
<code>__extension__</code>.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them. 
See <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.4/gcc/Alternate-Keywords.html#Alternate-Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>.

     </p><p>Some users try to use <samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp> to check programs for strict ISO
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all—only those for which
ISO C <em>requires</em> a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.

     </p><p>A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from <samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp>.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.

     </p><p>Where the standard specified with <samp><span class="option">-std</span></samp> represents a GNU
extended dialect of C, such as `<samp><span class="samp">gnu89</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">gnu99</span></samp>', there is a
corresponding <dfn>base standard</dfn>, the version of ISO C on which the GNU
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from <samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp> are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It would not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified GNU
C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)

     <br></p></dd><dt><code>-pedantic-errors</code></dt><dd><a name="index-pedantic_002derrors-188"></a>Like <samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp>, except that errors are produced rather than
warnings.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-w</code></dt><dd><a name="index-w-189"></a>Inhibit all warning messages.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-Wno-import</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wno_002dimport-190"></a>Inhibit warning messages about the use of `<samp><span class="samp">#import</span></samp>'.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-Wchar-subscripts</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wchar_002dsubscripts-191"></a>Warn if an array subscript has type <code>char</code>.  This is a common cause
of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on some
machines.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-Wcomment</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wcomment-192"></a>Warn whenever a comment-start sequence `<samp><span class="samp">/*</span></samp>' appears in a `<samp><span class="samp">/*</span></samp>'
comment, or whenever a Backslash-Newline appears in a `<samp><span class="samp">//</span></samp>' comment.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-Wformat</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wformat-193"></a>Check calls to <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code>, etc., to make sure that
the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string make
sense.  This includes standard functions, and others specified by format
attributes (see <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.4/gcc/Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>), in the <code>printf</code>,
<code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> and <code>strfmon</code> (an X/Open extension,
not in the C standard) families.

     <p>The formats are checked against the format features supported by GNU
libc version 2.2.  These include all ISO C90 and C99 features, as well
as features from the Single Unix Specification and some BSD and GNU
extensions.  Other library implementations may not support all these
features; GCC does not support warning about features that go beyond a
particular library's limitations.  However, if <samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp> is used
with <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp>, warnings will be given about format features not
in the selected standard version (but not for <code>strfmon</code> formats,
since those are not in any version of the C standard).  See <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.4.4/gcc/C-Dialect-Options.html#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

     </p><p>Since <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> also checks for null format arguments for
several functions, <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> also implies <samp><span class="option">-Wnonnull</span></samp>.

     </p><p><samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> is included in <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>.  For more control over some
aspects of format checking, the options <samp><span class="option">-Wformat-y2k</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-Wno-format-extra-args</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Wno-format-zero-length</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">-Wformat-nonliteral</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-Wformat-security</span></samp>, and
<samp><span class="option">-Wformat=2</span></samp> are available, but are not included in <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp>.

     <br></p></dd><dt><code>-Wformat-y2k</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wformat_002dy2k-194"></a>If <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> is specified, also warn about <code>strftime</code>
formats which may yield only a two-digit year.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-Wno-format-extra-args</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wno_002dformat_002dextra_002dargs-195"></a>If <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> is specified, do not warn about excess arguments to a
<code>printf</code> or <code>scanf</code> format function.  The C standard specifies
that such arguments are ignored.

     <p>Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments that are
specified with `<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>' operand number specifications, normally
warnings are still given, since the implementation could not know what
type to pass to <code>va_arg</code> to skip the unused arguments.  However,
in the case of <code>scanf</code> formats, this option will suppress the
warning if the unused arguments are all pointers, since the Single
Unix Specification says that such unused arguments are allowed.

     <br></p></dd><dt><code>-Wno-format-zero-length</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wno_002dformat_002dzero_002dlength-196"></a>If <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> is specified, do not warn about zero-length formats. 
The C standard specifies that zero-length formats are allowed.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-Wformat-nonliteral</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wformat_002dnonliteral-197"></a>If <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> is specified, also warn if the format string is not a
string literal and so cannot be checked, unless the format function
takes its format arguments as a <code>va_list</code>.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-Wformat-security</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wformat_002dsecurity-198"></a>If <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> is specified, also warn about uses of format
functions that represent possible security problems.  At present, this
warns about calls to <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code> functions where the
format string is not a string literal and there are no format arguments,
as in <code>printf (foo);</code>.  This may be a security hole if the format
string came from untrusted input and contains `<samp><span class="samp">%n</span></samp>'.  (This is
currently a subset of what <samp><span class="option">-Wformat-nonliteral</span></samp> warns about, but
in future warnings may be added to <samp><span class="option">-Wformat-security</span></samp> that are not
included in <samp><span class="option">-Wformat-nonliteral</span></samp>.)

     <br></dd><dt><code>-Wformat=2</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wformat_003d2-199"></a>Enable <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp> plus format checks not included in
<samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp>.  Currently equivalent to `<samp><span class="samp">-Wformat
-Wformat-nonliteral -Wformat-security -Wformat-y2k</span></samp>'.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-Wnonnull</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wnonnull-200"></a>Warn about passing a null pointer for arguments marked as
requiring a non-null value by the <code>nonnull</code> function attribute.

     <p><samp><span class="option">-Wnonnull</span></samp> is included in <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-Wformat</span></samp>.  It
can be disabled with the <samp><span class="option">-Wno-nonnull</span></samp> option.

     <br></p></dd><dt><code>-Winit-self </code><span class="roman">(C, C++, and Objective-C only)</span></dt><dd><a name="index-Winit_002dself-201"></a>Warn about uninitialized variables which are initialized with themselves. 
Note this option can only be used with the <samp><span class="option">-Wuninitialized</span></samp> option,
which in turn only works with <samp><span class="option">-O1</span></samp> and above.

     <p>For example, GCC will warn about <code>i</code> being uninitialized in the
following snippet only when <samp><span class="option">-Winit-self</span></samp> has been specified:
     </p><pre class="smallexample">          int f()
          {
            int i = i;
            return i;
          }
     </pre>
     <br></dd><dt><code>-Wimplicit-int</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wimplicit_002dint-202"></a>Warn when a declaration does not specify a type.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-Wimplicit-function-declaration</code></dt><dt><code>-Werror-implicit-function-declaration</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wimplicit_002dfunction_002ddeclaration-203"></a><a name="index-Werror_002dimplicit_002dfunction_002ddeclaration-204"></a>Give a warning (or error) whenever a function is used before being
declared.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-Wimplicit</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wimplicit-205"></a>Same as <samp><span class="option">-Wimplicit-int</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-Wimplicit-function-declaration</span></samp>.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-Wmain</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wmain-206"></a>Warn if the type of `<samp><span class="samp">main</span></samp>' is suspicious.  `<samp><span class="samp">main</span></samp>' should be a
function with external linkage, returning int, taking either zero
arguments, two, or three arguments of appropriate types.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-Wmissing-braces</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wmissing_002dbraces-207"></a>Warn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully bracketed.  In
the following example, the initializer for `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>' is not fully
bracketed, but that for `<samp><span class="samp">b</span></samp>' is fully bracketed.

     <pre class="smallexample">          int a[2][2] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
          int b[2][2] = { { 0, 1 }, { 2, 3 } };
     </pre>
     <br></dd><dt><code>-Wparentheses</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wparentheses-208"></a>Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such
as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.

     <p>Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
<code>if</code> statement an <code>else</code> branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:

     </p><pre class="smallexample">          {
            if (a)
              if (b)
                foo ();
            else
              bar ();
          }
     </pre>
     <p>In C, every <code>else</code> branch belongs to the innermost possible <code>if</code>
statement, which in this example is <code>if (b)</code>.  This is often not
what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above example by
indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the potential for this
confusion, GCC will issue a warning when this flag is specified. 
To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around the innermost
<code>if</code> statement so there is no way the <code>else</code> could belong to
the enclosing <code>if</code>.  The resulting code would look like this:

     </p><pre class="smallexample">          {
            if (a)
              {
                if (b)
                  foo ();
                else
                  bar ();
              }
          }
     </pre>
     <br></dd><dt><code>-Wsequence-point</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wsequence_002dpoint-209"></a>Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C standard.

     <p>The C standard defines the order in which expressions in a C program are
evaluated in terms of <dfn>sequence points</dfn>, which represent a partial
ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those executed
before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These occur
after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part of a
larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>? :</code> or <code>,</code> (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places. 
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.

     </p><p>It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C standard specifies that “Between the
previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value
modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.  Furthermore,
the prior value shall be read only to determine the value to be
stored.”.  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.

     </p><p>Examples of code with undefined behavior are <code>a = a++;</code>, <code>a[n]
= b[n++]</code> and <code>a[i++] = i;</code>.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.

     </p><p>The present implementation of this option only works for C programs.  A
future implementation may also work for C++ programs.

     </p><p>The C standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases. 
Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at

     <br></p></dd><dt><code>-Wreturn-type</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wreturn_002dtype-210"></a>Warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that defaults to

     <p>For C++, a function without return type always produces a diagnostic

warning.)  <code>case</code> labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used.

     <p>In order to get a warning about an unused function parameter, you must
either specify `<samp><span class="samp">-Wextra -Wunused</span></samp>' (note that `<samp><span class="samp">-Wall</span></samp>' implies
`<samp><span class="samp">-Wunused</span></samp>'), or separately specify <samp><span class="option">-Wunused-parameter</span></samp>.

if a variable may be clobbered by a <code>setjmp</code> call.

     <p>These warnings are possible only in optimizing compilation,
because they require data flow information that is computed only
when optimizing.  If you don't specify <samp><span class="option">-O</span></samp>, you simply won't
get these warnings.

     </p><p>If you want to warn about code which uses the uninitialized value of the
variable in its own initializer, use the <samp><span class="option">-Winit-self</span></samp> option.

     </p><p>These warnings occur only for variables that are candidates for
register allocation.  Therefore, they do not occur for a variable that
is declared <code>volatile</code>, or whose address is taken, or whose size
is other than 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.  Also, they do not occur for
structures, unions or arrays, even when they are in registers.

     </p><p>Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.

     </p><p>These warnings are made optional because GCC is not smart
enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct

this can happen:

     <p class="noindent">If the value of <code>y</code> is always 1, 2 or 3, then <code>x</code> is

another common case:

<dt><code>-Wextra</code></dt><dd><a name="index-W-229"></a><a name="index-Wextra-230"></a>(This option used to be called <samp><span class="option">-W</span></samp>.  The older name is still
supported, but the newer name is more descriptive.)  Print extra warning
messages for these events:

          <ul>
<li>A function can return either with or without a value.  (Falling
off the end of the function body is considered returning without
a value.)  For example, this function would evoke such a
warning:

          <pre class="smallexample">               foo (a)
               {
                 if (a &gt; 0)
                   return a;
               }
          </pre>
          </li><li>An expression-statement or the left-hand side of a comma expression
contains no side effects. 
To suppress the warning, cast the unused expression to void. 
For example, an expression such as `<samp><span class="samp">x[i,j]</span></samp>' will cause a warning,
but `<samp><span class="samp">x[(void)i,j]</span></samp>' will not.

          </li><li>An unsigned value is compared against zero with `<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">&gt;=</span></samp>'.

          </li><li>A comparison like `<samp><span class="samp">x&lt;=y&lt;=z</span></samp>' appears; this is equivalent to
`<samp><span class="samp">(x&lt;=y ? 1 : 0) &lt;= z</span></samp>', which is a different interpretation from
that of ordinary mathematical notation.

          </li><li>Storage-class specifiers like <code>static</code> are not the first things in
a declaration.  According to the C Standard, this usage is obsolescent.

          </li><li>The return type of a function has a type qualifier such as <code>const</code>. 
Such a type qualifier has no effect, since the value returned by a
function is not an lvalue.  (But don't warn about the GNU extension of
<code>volatile void</code> return types.  That extension will be warned about
if <samp><span class="option">-pedantic</span></samp> is specified.)

          </li><li>If <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-Wunused</span></samp> is also specified, warn about unused
arguments.

          </li><li>A comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce an
incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned. 
(But don't warn if <samp><span class="option">-Wno-sign-compare</span></samp> is also specified.)

          </li><li>An aggregate has an initializer which does not initialize all members. 
For example, the following code would cause such a warning, because
<code>x.h</code> would be implicitly initialized to zero:

          <pre class="smallexample">               struct s { int f, g, h; };
               struct s x = { 3, 4 };
          </pre>
          </li><li>A function parameter is declared without a type specifier in K&amp;R-style
functions:

          <pre class="smallexample">               void foo(bar) { }
          </pre>
          </li><li>An empty body occurs in an `<samp><span class="samp">if</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">else</span></samp>' statement.

          </li><li>A pointer is compared against integer zero with `<samp><span class="samp">&lt;</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">&lt;=</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>', or `<samp><span class="samp">&gt;=</span></samp>'.

          </li><li>A variable might be changed by `<samp><span class="samp">longjmp</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">vfork</span></samp>'.

          </li><li>Any of several floating-point events that often indicate errors, such as
overflow, underflow, loss of precision, etc.

          </li><li><span class="roman">(C++ only)</span>

Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed, on the assumption
that they usually do not indicate real problems and would only make the
compiler output harder to read.  Using this command line option tells
GCC to emit warnings from system headers as if they occurred in user
code.  However, note that using <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp> in conjunction with this
option will <em>not</em> warn about unknown pragmas in system
headers—for that, <samp><span class="option">-Wunknown-pragmas</span></samp> must also be used.

     <br></dd><dt><code>-Wfloat-equal</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Wfloat_002dequal-236"></a>Warn if floating point values are used in equality comparisons.

     <p>The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
would check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.

     <br></p></dd><dt><code>-Wtraditional </code><span class="roman">(C only)</span></dt><dd><a name="index-Wtraditional-237"></a>Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs which should be avoided.

          <ul>
<li>Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body. 
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but does not in ISO C.

          </li><li>In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist. 
Traditional preprocessors would only consider a line to be a directive
if the `<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>' appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
<samp><span class="option">-Wtraditional</span></samp> warns about directives that traditional C
understands but would ignore because the `<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>' does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
`<samp><span class="samp">#pragma</span></samp>' not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations would not recognize `<samp><span class="samp">#elif</span></samp>', so it
suggests avoiding it altogether.

          </li><li>A function-like macro that appears without arguments.

          </li><li>The unary plus operator.

          </li><li>The `<samp><span class="samp">U</span></samp>' integer constant suffix, or the `<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>' floating point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the `<samp><span class="samp">L</span></samp>' suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the `<samp><span class="samp">_MIN</span></samp>'/`<samp><span class="samp">_MAX</span></samp>' macros in <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>. 
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however GCC's integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.

          </li><li>A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.

          </li><li>A <code>switch</code> statement has an operand of type <code>long</code>.

          </li><li>A non-<code>static</code> function declaration follows a <code>static</code> one. 
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.

          </li><li>The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.

          </li><li>Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.

          </li><li>Initialization of automatic aggregates.

          </li><li>Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.

          </li><li>Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. <code>__STDC__</code> to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.

          </li><li>Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C would cause serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings, for the full set use <samp><span class="option">-Wconversion</span></samp>.

          </li><li>Use of ISO C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
<em>not</em> issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these ISO C features will appear in your code when using
libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, <code>PARAMS</code> and
<code>VPARAMS</code>.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a GCC extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.

     </p><p>This option is not made part of <samp><span class="option">-Wall</span></samp> because in a debugging
version of a program there is often substantial code which checks
correct functioning of the program and is, hopefully, unreachable
because the program does work.  Another common use of unreachable
code is to provide behavior which is selectable at compile-time.

     <br></p></dd><dt><code>-Winline</code></dt><dd><a name="index-Winline-269"></a>Warn if a function can not be inlined and it was declared as inline. 
Even with this option, the compiler will not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.

     <p>The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
warnings produced by <samp><span class="option">-Winline</span></samp> to appear or disappear.

     <br></p></dd><dt><code>-Wno-invalid-offsetof </code><span class="roman">(C++ only)</span></dt><dd><a name="index-Wno_002dinvalid_002doffsetof-270"></a>Suppress warnings from applying the `<samp><span class="samp">offsetof</span></samp>' macro to a non-POD
type.  According to the 1998 ISO C++ standard, applying `<samp><span class="samp">offsetof</span></samp>'
to a non-POD type is undefined.  In existing C++ implementations,
however, `<samp><span class="samp">offsetof</span></samp>' typically gives meaningful results even when
applied to certain kinds of non-POD types. (Such as a simple
`<samp><span class="samp">struct</span></samp>' that fails to be a POD type only by virtue of having a
constructor.)  This flag is for users who are aware that they are
writing nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the
warning about it.

     <p>The restrictions on `<samp><span class="samp">offsetof</span></samp>' may be relaxed in a future version
of the C++ standard.

not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it
merely indicates that GCC's optimizers were unable to handle the code
effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too
complex; GCC will refuse to optimize programs when the optimization
itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of time.
